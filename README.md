# pubannotation_json_viewer

## Usage

1. Put the Pubannotation file in the same directory as `index.html`.

2. Open the `index.html` with browser. I recommend Microsoft Edge.

    - If you want to use Google Chrome, you must change the security settings because of CORS policy. (See Also: [Disable same origin policy in Chrome -stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome))
  
3. Input the file name to InputBox, then click `set file name`.

4. Push `json` button to parse and show the text, and you can get hilighted text by clicking `highlight` button.

    - ID can be displayed in the upper right corner of the screen by mouse over.
